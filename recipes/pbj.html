        <h3>description</h3>
        <p>If there's one certainty in life, it's that you can never go wrong with a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich. When i was a wee lad, my mother used to climb mountains to milk strawberry cows, and used to mine the caves for peanut butter. She did all this so she can see the smile on my face as I devoured this sandwich, in about 10 seconds. 
            I want to bring this same joy to your kitchen. For this recipe you will need:
        </p>
        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>white bread, 2 slices (your preference really but white bread is og)</li>
            <li>jelly, 1 tbsp (again, this is your preference but i recommend bonne maman strawberry preserves)</li>
            <li>peanut butter (any but probably not the kind with no sugar, yuck)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> grab 2 slices of white bread (or whatever bread you chose)</li>
            <li>slather BOTH sides with peanut butter</li>
            <li> apply a good thick layer of jelly on one or the other slice, but essentially has to be enough to justify both breads having peanut butter.</li>
            <h5> extra steps</h5>
            <li>add butter to the outside bread and toast it on each side</li>
            <li> add bananas inside between steps 2-3</li>
        </ol>
